Blackboard "To measure" evaluation:

1) Deformations of Each Mechanical Part, Including Joints (Bearings)
- I believe the code is Okay, and I have no more ideas on more analysis that
we can do to detect deformation
---- But the tracking can be improved for better results
How to improve? (Personal suggestion)
---- Use Berkay's code that has proper lighting and use better masks as well.

2) Detecting Vibration Frequencies in the System
- I think the code for drawing the motion and speed graph is Good
----- But the Fourier Transfrom analysis can be improved.
----- I tried my best but I'm not good at MATLAB so I mostly depended on chatGPT's code suggestions
-----
----- I also don't have better ideas on how we can detect vibration, this is the best I got

3) Validating the Virtual Controller Trajectory Using Camera-Measured Trajectories
- This one my understanding is we compare our Motion and Speed Graph to thier graphs.
- So use sameer's code that he used to plot the .CVS file and compare it to our own

4) Detecting Differences Between the Motions of the 7 Recordings
- Here again my understanding is we have to compare the motion and speed Graphs of 7 videos
- We already have the script so we just generate 7 graphs and compare them
- I haven't download the rest 6 videos so maybe sone who already did can run the script on them

I also pushes some graphs... obliviously we will replace those graphs if we improve our script now
and get better results, but those are graphs are my idea of how we do practical Elaboration
